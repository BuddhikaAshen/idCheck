# NSBM ID Checker


I created this project during my 1st year, 2nd semester while studying PHP for my Web Application Development module. I recently checked my old hard disk and found this project, and I didn’t want to forget it. This is the best and funniest thing I ever did in my first year, and I’m really glad I found it again. So, I decided to upload it to my GitHub. Back in those days, I didn’t know about GitHub, so I never thought of uploading it before.
